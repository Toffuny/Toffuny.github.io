<p>These two videos depict two things people go through everyday: getting up and going to bed. I wanted to showcase the two things that everyone goes through everyday in a way that people can relate to, yet has parts that are distinctly mine. Not everybody has a dog and not everybody eats eggs for breakfast but that doesn't take away from the fact that most people will personally connect with the videos.
  I wanted to create videos that showcased myself yet can connect well with its audience. </p>
